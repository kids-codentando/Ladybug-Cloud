# 🐞 Ladybug Cloud — Multi-Tenant WhatsApp Bot Hosting

A free, self-hostable platform for running **Ladybug Mini** WhatsApp bots. Users sign up for free, paste their session ID, and get their own isolated bot process. An admin panel lets you install/update the bot code and manage every user and bot.

Built by **Ntandomods** · Deployable on **Render** in one click.

## ✨ Features

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Free accounts** | Public registration with bcrypt-hashed passwords and cookie sessions |
| **Session IDs** | Each user pastes their own `Ladybug!...` session; stored per-user and injected as `SESSION_ID` |
| **⚡ In-browser pairing** | Users generate a session themselves: enter a phone number, get an 8-digit WhatsApp pairing code, session is built automatically — no local setup |
| **📊 Public status page** | `/status` shows live platform health, running bots, uptime and per-bot status (session IDs never exposed) |
| **Isolation** | One `node index.js` process per bot, separate `session_<botId>` folder, separate temp dir |
| **Control** | Start / stop / restart, auto-restart with backoff (5 attempts), live status badges |
| **Logs** | 600-line ring buffer per bot, streamed to a live console in the dashboard |
| **Admin panel** | Stats, user management (plan/limit/ban/delete), all bots, one-click installer |
| **Installer** | Install Ladybug Mini from GitHub, upload a ZIP, or re-run `npm install` for the bot |
| **Free tier limit** | 1 bot per free user, 10 for pro, unlimited for admin — all configurable |

## 🚀 Deploy on Render

### Option A — Blueprint (recommended)

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render: **New → Blueprint**, pick the repo. Render reads `render.yaml`.
3. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (defaults to `mods`) and click **Apply**.
4. Wait for the first deploy, open the URL, log in as **Ntando / mods**.
5. Go to **Admin → Installer → Install from GitHub**. Done.

### Self-healing bot dependencies

The bot source is installed without its `node_modules` (they are gitignored), and on an
ephemeral filesystem they vanish on every redeploy. The platform now repairs itself:

- Installing the bot (GitHub or ZIP) automatically starts `npm install` in `bots/ladybug`.
- Starting a bot checks `node_modules` first; if anything is missing it installs the
  dependencies, streams the output into the bot log as `[deps] ...`, then starts the bot.
- On boot, any bot that was running is only resumed after dependencies are verified.
- If a crash is caused by `Cannot find module`, the host stops the restart loop and tells
  you to run **Admin → Bot Installer → Install Dependencies** instead of retrying 5 times.
- Lifecycle scripts are allowed during install (`NPM_CONFIG_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_ALL_SCRIPTS`),
  otherwise npm 11.6+/12 skips them and native modules such as `sharp`, `canvas` and
  `ffmpeg-static` end up broken.

> **Free vs persistent data:** Render's free plan has **no persistent disk**, so accounts, bots and session folders live on the ephemeral filesystem and reset whenever the service redeploys or wakes from sleep. That is fine for trying it out. For permanent storage, switch the service to `plan: starter`, uncomment the `disk:` block in `render.yaml`, and set `DATA_DIR=/var/data` and `BOT_DIR=/var/data/bots/ladybug`.

### Option B — Manual Web Service

- **Environment:** Node
- **Build:** `npm install`
- **Start:** `node server.js`
- **Disk:** optional — add a 1 GB disk at `/var/data` only if you use a paid instance (free plans can't mount disks)
- **Env vars:**

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=Ntando
ADMIN_PASSWORD=mods
SESSION_SECRET=<random long string>
DATA_DIR=/var/data          # or ./data on the free plan
BOT_DIR=/var/data/bots/ladybug
NODE_ENV=production
```

Health check path: `/healthz`

## 🧑‍💻 Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # edit if you like
npm start
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Default admin: **Ntando / mods**.

After logging in as admin, install the bot code:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:3000/api/admin/installer/github \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:3000/api/admin/installer/deps
```

## 🔑 Getting a session ID

Users don't need to run anything locally. In **Dashboard → New Bot** they enter their phone number with country code and click **Get code**. The platform asks WhatsApp for a pairing code, shows it in the browser, and once the user enters it under *WhatsApp → Linked devices → Link with phone number*, the session is generated and filled in automatically.

A session ID looks like:

```
Ladybug!H4sIAAAAAAAA...   (base64 of gzipped creds.json)
```

It can also be pasted manually if the user already has one. The host only ever shows a masked preview afterwards.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Render's free tier spins down idle services; bots stop when the instance sleeps. Use a paid instance or an uptime pinger for 24/7 bots.
- Session IDs are secrets. They are stored in `db.json` on the persistent disk — restrict access to the disk and rotate `SESSION_SECRET` if leaked.
- Change the default admin password before exposing the service publicly.
